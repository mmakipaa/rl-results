    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook visualizes the results of testing selected Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we present a comparison of different learning strategies for parameter _epsilon_ with on-policy Monte Carlo. We run the test using our simple blackjack implementation as a test environment. Strategies tested include inverse visit count, scaled visit count and scaled exponential decay, where we define target value to be reached at 90% of learning iterations. We test scaled visit count and exponential strategies with two alternative parameters each. See https://github.com/mmakipaa/rl/blob/main/utils/sequence.py for implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Monte Carlo methods, _epsilon_ is the only requred learning parameter as _alpha_ is not defined - updates are based on incremental average for each state-action pair and visit count is used in the calculation.\n",
